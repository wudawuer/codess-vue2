## slotScope
#### slotScope
Used to denote an element or component as a scoped slot. The attributeâ€™s value should be a valid JavaScript expression that can appear in the argument position of a function signature. This means in supported environments you can also use ES2015 destructuring in the expression. Serves as a replacement for scope in 2.5.0+.
